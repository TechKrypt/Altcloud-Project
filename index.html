            <p>
                This project involves setting up a Linux-based server on AWS to host a web application. We provisioned an EC2 instance, installed Nginx as the web server, and configured networking to allow HTTP traffic. A custom HTML landing page was created and deployed to demonstrate the team's capabilities. The setup also includes troubleshooting connectivity issues to ensure the page is accessible publicly.
